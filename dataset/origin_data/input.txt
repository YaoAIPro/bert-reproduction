Long ago, in Roland, a small country surrounded by high mountains and dense forests, there lived a young and beautiful princess named Lillian. Lillian was only 18 years old. She had long golden hair and bright blue eyes. Her laughter was as sweet as a mountain spring. She was famous for her charity and kindness. She was an angel in the hearts of people at home and abroad. Unfortunately, Lillian's stepmother, the current queen, was named Cassandra. Cassandra was 42 years old. She was once a well-known wizard. Later, she became the queen through her witchcraft and strategy. Cassandra had always been jealous of Lillian's beauty and the love of her people. She only wanted power and control. Cassandra's magic mirror was one of her most precious spells. Every day, she would ask the magic mirror: "Mirror, mirror, tell me, who is the most beautiful woman in this country?" Cassandra's anger and jealousy reached a peak after the magic mirror changed its answer that day. She ordered a hunter in the kingdom, a 35-year-old taciturn but kind-hearted man, to take Lillian into the deep forest and end her life. However, the hunter was unable to carry out his order at the last moment and he let the princess go, telling her never to look back. Lillian got lost in the forest and finally found a hut at dusk. The hut was inhabited by seven little foxes, each with a different personality and skills, the youngest fox was only 3 years old and the oldest was 15 years old. The little foxes were very smart and friendly, and they decided to protect Lillian and treat her as a member of the family. Meanwhile, the queen learned that Lillian was still alive and protected by the little foxes. She decided to take action herself, disguised as an old woman, brought poisoned apples to the hut, and successfully put Lillian into a deep sleep. Fortunately, a young prince, 25-year-old Alexander, heard the little foxes' plea while hunting nearby. He fell in love with Lillian at first sight and asked the old witch in the forest for help. The witch used her magic to wake Lillian up. After waking up, Lillian and the prince teamed up to expose Cassandra's conspiracy.
The king was very angry after hearing the truth, and he ordered Cassandra to be exiled. Lillian and the prince's wedding was held in the spring, and the citizens participated in it to celebrate their happiness and the new future of the country. From then on, Lillian and Alexander jointly ruled Roland, bringing peace and prosperity, and the king also enjoyed true happiness in his later years. The little foxes were also invited to become guests of the court and live happily with Lillian's family forever.
